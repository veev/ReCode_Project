The program consists of three call orders:

1. Size of the sheet of paper.
2. A scale distortion of 1:2 in one direction.
3. The routine SNEKAD with eight parameters. The routine SNEKAO proves here two elements: 1. <horizontal lines> 2. <vertical lines>. These squares occur in a random order. The scale distortion of 1:2 stretches the elements in one direction to produce graying effects.
